# Project-Oriented Workflows with Git and GitHub

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains materials for a basic intro to project-oriented coding with Git and Github. 

In preparation for going over the materials here please

1. Create an account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) if you have not done so already
  - Note the email address you use to register with GitHub


2. [Install](https://git-scm.com/) and [set up](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html) Git on your system if you have not already done so
  - When introducing yourself to Git, it will be much easier if you use the same email address here as you do with GitHub, see instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html) and [here](https://fish497.github.io/website/lectures/week_02/lec_05_intro_git.html)

The presentation (still a work in progress) can be viewed [here](https://oars-safs.github.io/projects-with-github/presentations/projects-with-github)


We will be going over come materials covered in Richard McElreath's [Science as Amateur Software Development](https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY) talk. It's about an hour long if you'd like to watch the whole thing before the workshop, but is not required (but highly recommended in general).

## Bonus Materials

Time permitting we will demonstrate some reproducible workflows using the `renv` package. If you'd like to be prepared to follow along with this step

1. Fork this repository and clone to your machine, or just download the repo. 

2. Open R and set your working directory of the cloned repository (or just use RStudio projects)

3. This project is set up with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. Inside R (and with your working directory set correctly) run `renv::restore()`. Follow all prompts. This will install the correct versions of all the packages needed to replicate our results. Packages are installed in a stand-alone project library for this paper, and will not affect your installed R packages anywhere else. 


### Troubleshooting

I intentionally included some code that requires particular computer settings in the make-reprex.R example included in this repo. This is intended to demonstrate both the ability of `renv` to keep complex dependencies, like particular branches of in development packages, in check, but also the limitations: it won't make sure you have Rtools installed correctly. 

Here are some tips to set up your computer to make-reprex.R

Make sure you try the run with a fresh R session (go to "Session>Restart R" to make sure)

If you run into an error, first off try updating your R packages. From there....

If your version of R is lower than 3.5, you might want to consider updating R itself. Updating from 3.51 to 3.52 shouldn't be any hassle. BIG WARNING THOUGH, updating from say R 3.1 to 3.5 is a major update, and you'll lose all your installed packages in the process. I recommend following the instructions [here](https://www.datascienceriot.com/r/upgrade-R-packages/) to deal with that, but even with that fix it can take a while, so I don't recommend doing a major R update if you're on a deadline. There are also packages to help you with this process, specifically [`installR`](https://github.com/talgalili/installr/issues) for Windows and [`updateR`](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/updateR) for Mac. 

From there...

- On Windows, make sure you have the appropriate version of Rtools installed ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)), most likely Rtools35 if you have R version 3.3 or higher
  - Make sure that you select the box that says something about adding Rtools to the PATH variable

- On macOS, there might be some issues with the your compiler. If you get an error that says something like `clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'`, follow the instructions [here](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/)

Be sure to look for informative error messages. Both TMB and stan often cause install problems

Once you've tried those, restart your computer and try and running `renv::restore()` again
