# Today's Content

The goal of this workshop isn't to turn you into Git experts in 1 hour. 

It's to show you that 

1. This stuff isn't that hard

2. This stuff can make your life easier

3. This stuff can make your science better

class: center, middle, inverse
# Science is all about reproducibility! 
# Why should it stop at our code?

???
Most of us trained in things like field methods: I've had way more classes in transect methods than coding practices.

Leads to methods that describe the brand of PVC pipe used but depend on a pile of code that will only work on the users computer for the week they submitted the paper, and never again

we put all this work into getting the data, and then drop the ball at the step that turns all that hard work into insight. 

As code becomes our primary tool, need to apply the same reprodicibility rigorous to our code that we're used to applying in our field methods

# The Solution: [Project-Oriented Workflows](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

>This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work” `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Jenny Bryan')`

- All files needed to run your analysis in one folder
  - Nested subfolders as needed
  - **Does not have to be RStudio**

- All analysis written assuming
  - Fresh state
  - Working directory set to project directory

### Workflow

*Personal decisions*

* Choice of IDE (RStudio, Sublime Text, scanning handwritten notes)

* CaMel or snake_case
  - But seriously, snake_case
  - See [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

* Your lucky coding socks

* **Where the code lives**
]
.pull-right[

### Product

*What the analysis needs*

* The data

* Packages

* Package versions

* Custom functions

* Scripts  to tie it all together

]

---

## Alternatives to `setwd`

Using RStudio is a simple way around this
  
  - Create .Rproj file in the root directory of your project
  - I recommend ignoring these in your.gitignore file
  
Alternatively...
 
  - Often just open a file in the project directory with R GUI/Atom/Whatever
  
  - If that fails, use `cd` / `setwd` from the command line/console (not in your script) when you open your analysis
  
  - `here` will often do the job for you
  

Using project-oriented workflow means that once you're in the working directory, everything else should work


**It's the user's, not the code's, responsibility to make sure the working directory is set correctly** $^1$

# Exorcise the paths

OK, you've created a project oriented workflow

Is this OK now?

`my_data <- read.csv("data\hake.csv")`

--
- Platform dependent

- Presents some problems for R Markdown

```{r}
getwd()
```

---


# File Paths with `here`

[`here`](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) is a great little package for managing file paths
  - Basically file.path with a bit of sugar
  
  
```{r}
here::dr_here()
```


`here` has a bunch of heuristics to figure out what the root of the project should be, and builds intelligent paths based on that

```{r}
here::here("data","hake.csv")
```

Looks for...
  - An RStudio project
  - a .git file
  - a .here file
  - etc.

---

# File Paths with `here`
Works on some machines...
```{r, error=TRUE}

hake <- read.csv("data\hake.csv")

```

Works in the markdown but won't work in the command line
```{r}
hake <- read.csv("../data/hake.csv")
```

Works on any platform and from anywhere in the project!
```{r}
hake <- read.csv(here("data","hake.csv"))
```

What about this?

```{r, error = TRUE}
hake <- read.csv(here("home-folder","Place-With_Data","hake.csv"))
```

# Project Oriented Workflows

The Ideal: 

.center[*Any user should be able to reproduce the project on any computer with only the materials in the project folder, without changing any code*]


Obviously easier said than done, but this is what we're aiming for. 

Now we'll see how Git + GitHub can help make this happen

---


# Git and GitHub are Great

.pull-left[

- Provides a clear and consistent way to version your results

- Allow others to easily reproduce your results

- Enables efficient and safe collaboration

- Gives you a time machine for your results

But, at first glance it seems like a lot of work that couldbe done easier with Google Drive / email / track changes

We'll try and demystify it a bit today

# What is Git?

Git is to GitHub what R is to RStudio


Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux kernel
  - Hence, interacting with Git only via the command line and the help files can feel... [confusing](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/#Zml4JCRmaWxl)
  
Git is a software package for tracking changes in files in an organized way.  
  - Create snapshots of the code at specific moments in time via "commits"
  - Use commits to merge together different versions of the same code / resolve conflicts
  - Allow for development across multiple "branches" of a project
  - And lots of other fun stuff

# Ways to Git

All Git commands can be executed in the command line- Command Prompt, Terminal.

There are also many different user interfaces for managing Git repositories.

- Dan's favourite: [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


- From the makers of Sublime Text: [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)


- From the developers of Github: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

# The **BASICS** of Git

Goal here isn't to teach Git in one hour, just to familiarize you with the concepts so you can start / improve your journey

See 

[Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)

[Oh Sh*t, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/) 
  
  * [Dangit, Git!](https://dangitgit.com/) if you're so inclined

# The **BASICS** of Git

Thankfully for most scientific collaboration across small-ish groups you usually don't need the complicated stuff

95% of my worflow uses variants of
- `commit`
- `pull`
- `push`
- `branch`
- `reset`

The rest of the stuff is there for when Sh*t hits the fan or for managing really complex projects

# Getting Started

This is sort of a thing unto itself, and probably at least "half the battle"

From Jenny Bryan's amazing [Happy Git and Github ](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html#install-intro)

> You will find far more resources for how to use Git than for installation and configuration. Why? The experts …

>    
  - Have been doing this for years. It’s simply not hard for them anymore.
  - Probably use some flavor of Unix. They may secretly (or not so secretly) take pride in neither using nor knowing Windows.
  - Get more satisfaction and reward for thinking and writing about Git concepts and workflows than Git installation.


To follow in the illustrious footprints of instructions assuming you can install it and set it up yourself...

We don't have time to solve this today, so see those resources. From here on I will assume you have successfully installed and set up git!

---


# Initializing a project with git...
## The manual way

Chances are if you're doing it this way you don't need my help. 

1. Create a new project using project-oriented workflow

2. Set working directory to the root directory of your project by **any means other than hard coding in a script**

3. Open up a command line... 
  - From RStudio: click on "Terminal" tab
  - Windows users: type "cmd" into your search bar
  - Mac users: type "terminal" into Spotlight
  - Linux users: you probably should know how to do this already

4. Initialize git repository from terminal by entering `git init`

This will set up your project to be tracked with Git, including by default all files starting in your working directory and in any nested folders from there
---


# Switching to GitHub

This is often where people get stuck picking up Git. 

You thought you were getting a handy tool to make your science better...

And I'm telling you to interact via the terminal with the same thing they use to manage the Linux kernel..

# Enter GitHub + Some Git GUI

The good news: Using GitHub along with some Git-enabled GUI like RStudio makes like *much easier*, particularly to get started. 

So I'm going to try and hook you with those features. 
  - Doesn't mean learning the more "command line" version of Git isn't important and helpful, but I find it easier to learn that after getting exposed to the more "interactive" style
  
The "GitHub first" worflow

Assuming you ahve succesfully set up Git on your computer... 

1. Create and log in to an account at GitHub.com

2. Create a repository on GitHub

3. Clone to your computer

4. Open project with your IDE of choice, assumed here to be RStudio


---

# Creating a Repository

There are lots of great resources for this....

See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

And Mark Scheuerell's excellent intro [here](https://fish497.github.io/website/lectures/week_02/lec_04_intro_github.html)

And I'll walk through this in class rather than taking a bunch of screenshots... 

Some tips


1. When given the option, select "add .gitignore" and assuming you're primarily working in R, select the R template (or whatever your main langauge is).
  - This will tell Git to ignore certain commonly ignored filetypes 
  
2. Select "choose a license" to have GitHub automatically create a software license for your project. I often choose the Mozilla license, the MIT is also popular. 

---


# Coming Down from the Cloud

OK, you've created a repository on GitHub! Now how do you use it?

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub

2. Click on the "Code" tab and select your mode 
  - HTML is by far the easiest, but it's worth setting up SSH if going to do this a lot, see [here](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html)
  
3. Easiest option: On your computer, open RStudio
  - Click on File > New Project > Version Control > Git
  - Paste the link from GitHub into the "Repository URL" and fill out the rest of the links

And *voilà*, you have a new project on your computer initialized with git and a .gitignore file (we'll come back to that)
---


# From here

Given the amount of resources out there for this, I'm not going to provide step-by-step instructions for an entire Git & Github lifestyle here.

Instead Mark Scheuerell and I are going to walk through some common collaboration examples

Think of this as a demo of the usefulness of Git + GitHub for scientific work, and a way to familiarize yourself with core concepts to then practice on your own. 

---

# `git commit -m "it all starts here"`

OK, you've *finally* gotten to the point where you can actually track some code! 

`git commit` is the workhorse of it all.

Think of commit like "Save, and yes I really mean it". 

You can of course save your code as you go along. But once you get your code to an important breakpoint, you want to then "commit" those saved changes

  - The first version of your code the works top to bottom
  - When you fix that bug you found
  - When you add that new feature
  
---

# `git commit -m "it all starts here"`

When you "commit", git takes a snapshot of all the files it is charged with tracking in your repository, gives it a timestamp and a unique identifier paired with your commit message. 

---

# What Should you Commit?

OK that sounds great, what should you actually use Git to keep track of though? By defult Git tracks *everything*. 

This isn't a good idea for a few reasons... 
  - Don't want to clutter up the repo with unneeded things
  - Commiting results can break link between code and outcomes
  - Git isn't meant to store your global database: avoid commiting data over tens of megabytes

My rule of thumb: track all things that are needed to reproduce your results, and as little of anything else as possible
  - e.g. I ignore .Rproj files: It assumes RStudio which isn't universal, and can conflict if different users store the project in differently named folders
