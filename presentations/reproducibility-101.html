# Science is all about reproducibility! 
# Why should it stop at our code?

???
Most of us trained in things like field methods: I've had way more classes in transect methods than coding practices.

Leads to methods that describe the brand of PVC pipe used but depend on a pile of code that will only work on the users computer for the week they submitted the paper, and never again

we put all this work into getting the data, and then drop the ball at the step that turns all that hard work into insight. 

As code becomes our primary tool, need to apply the same reprodicibility rigorous to our code that we're used to applying in our field methods

# [Project-Oriented Workflows](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

&gt;This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work” &lt;footer&gt;--- Jenny Bryan&lt;/footer&gt;

- All files needed to run your analysis in one folder
  - Nested subfolders as needed
  - **Does not have to be RStudio**

- All analysis written assuming
  - Fresh state
  - Working directory set to project directory

# Git and GitHub are Great

.pull-left[

  - Make getting to the final product easier and safer
  - Allow others to easily use your results
  - Allows you to easily version your results
  
From a pure *reproducibility* perspective though, not strictly needed

- Could use email/dropbox/whatever to manage all your versions

- Publish the final reproducible code and results to say figshare without git/GitHub

So, we're not going to focus on git here today

# Purge `setwd` from your scripts

&gt; *If the first line of your R script is*
  
&gt;  setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")
  
&gt;  *I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE* 🔥.
  
 &gt; *If the first line of your R script is*

# What's wrong with `setwd`?

.pull-left[
### Workflow

*Personal decisions*

* Choice of IDE (RStudio, Sublime Text, scanning handwritten notes)

* CaMel or snake_case
  - But seriously, snake_case
  - See [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

* Your lucky coding socks

* **Where the code lives**

.pull-right[

### Product

*What the analysis needs*

* The data

* Packages

* Package versions

* Custom functions

* Scripts  to tie it all together

## Alternatives to `setwd`

Using RStudio is a simple way around this
  
  - Create .Rproj file in the root directory of your project
  - I recommend ignoring these in your.gitignore file
  
Alternatively...
 
  - Often just open a file in the project directory with R GUI/Atom/Whatever
  
  - If that fails, use `cd` / `setwd` from the command line/console (not in your script) when you open your analysis
  
  - `here` will often do the job for you
  

Using project-oriented workflow means that once you're in the working directory, everything else should work


**It's the user's, not the code's, responsibility to make sure the working directory is set correctly** `\(^1\)`

.footnote[
[1] But do what works best for your workflow

# Exorcise the paths

OK, you've created a project oriented workflow

Is this OK now?

`my_data &lt;- read.csv("data\hake.csv")`

--
- Platform dependent

- Presents some problems for R Markdown


```r
getwd()
```

```
## [1] "/Users/danovan/teaching/reproducible-workflow/presentations"
```

---


# File Paths with `here`

[`here`](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) is a great little package for managing file paths
  - Basically file.path with a bit of sugar
  
  

```r
here::dr_here()
```

```
## here() starts at /Users/danovan/teaching/reproducible-workflow, because it contains a file matching `[.]Rproj$` with contents matching `^Version: ` in the first line
```


`here` has a bunch of heuristics to figure out what the root of the project should be, and builds intelligent paths based on that


```r
here::here("data","hake.csv")
```

```
## [1] "/Users/danovan/teaching/reproducible-workflow/data/hake.csv"
```

Looks for...
  - An RStudio project
  - a .git file
  - a .here file
  - etc.

---

# File Paths with `here`
Works on some machines...

```r

hake &lt;- read.csv("data\hake.csv")
```

```
## Error: '\h' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""data\h"
```

Works in the markdown but won't work in the command line

```r
hake &lt;- read.csv("../data/hake.csv")
```

Works on any platform and from anywhere in the project!

```r
hake &lt;- read.csv(here("data","hake.csv"))
```

What about this?


```r
hake &lt;- read.csv(here("home-folder","Place-With_Data","hake.csv"))
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open file '/Users/danovan/teaching/
## reproducible-workflow/home-folder/Place-With_Data/hake.csv': No such file or
## directory
```

```
## Error in file(file, "rt"): cannot open the connection
```


---

# Package dependencies with renv

OK, you now have a project oriented workflow, and you fixed your paths, what else?

We've all been here...

```r
hake &lt;- as.data.table(hake)
```

```
## Error in as.data.table(hake): could not find function "as.data.table"
```

Packages are a huge part of reproducibility - even the most "base or bust!" code usually has some package dependencies, and of course base R itself changes
  - R 4.0 = no more `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`!!

- Minimum solution: include ***all*** needed libraries at the start of your main script


```r
# my amazing wrapper scripts ----------------
# load libraries
library(here)
library(data.table)
```

---

# Package dependencies with `renv`

What does this leave out?


```r
# my amazing wrapper scripts ----------------

# load libraries
library(here)
library(data.table)
```

--

Particularly for our kind of science-heavy packages we often depend on a *specific version* of a packages
  - Hopefully just a minimum package version 
  - But sometimes...
      - we need an older version
      - we need a specific development version 😟
      
Enter `renv`!

---

# Package dependencies with `renv`

[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) is a relatively new package manager solution from the folks at RStudio
  - See Grant McDermott's [excellent talk](https://www.periscope.tv/grant_mcdermott/1lPJqLjlVAAGb) on it


`renv` basically takes snapshots of

  - the packages used in a project
  - the dependencies of those packages
  - the versions as of install time of all packages and dependencies
    - including the source!
  - Support for CRAN, bioconductor, github, etc. 

---

# Package dependencies with `renv`

From a pure reproducibility standpoint `renv` is great

  - Prevents you from having to manually compile a list of dependencies to include in your scripts
  - Makes it easy to load your project on new computers
  - Can be used as a package version time machine!

From a practical perspective has some very nice tricks

  - Every project has its own cache! No more "I don't update any packages because I need the ancient version of some specific package in order for my code to run"
    - Can have `icesDatras` v1.3 in one project and v1.0 in another
  - But, if it can share installs across projects it does so (saves on memory and install time)
---

# `renv` in action

Break to see how `renv` can reproduce a complicated package on a new computer

---

# Docker

So, we've

- Created a project-oriented workflow
- Gotten rid of `setwd` and any hard-coded paths
- Used `renv` to manage our package dependencies
- **RESTARTED R AND MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING RUNS**

Seems like this is a pretty full-proof path to reproducibility, except.....

--

Computer setup. 

---

# Docker

Even if you have all the packages and file paths right, you need a computer to run code. 

`renv` &amp; friends don't

  - Make sure you have R installed
  - Have the correct compiler tools set up
  - Ensure you have the right support applications installed (e.g. libgdal)
  
This is where [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and virtual machines come in
  
---

# Docker

Basically, Docker allows you to create a virtual machine on your computer that for example
- Has R installed
- Has the compiler tools setup correctly
- Has all the other things you need installed (e.g. libgdal)

Docker won't save you from fundamental hardware problems (e.g. if a given program can only run on a PC)
  - Dedicated server + Docker...
  
We don't have time to cover Docker here, and unfortunately it's a bit complicated.
  - Worth it if you're writing complicated code that needs to be reproduced on a wide variety of machines
  - Otherwise, I'd stick with the workflow outlined here, but inclued clear instructions in the project README detailing all the non-R steps that need to be taken

# Putting things into practice

# What to do about Data?

Software development has a lot we can pull directly from to increase the reproducibility of our research

But, there are a few places hijacking the software pipeline for science gets clunky

I push small-to-medium data to GitHub. [GitHub Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage) is also an option, but costs money 
  
For Bigish data
  - Dropbox/google drive etc. are all fine options - you can query them all directly from R
  - I usually have a check in my code to see if it's already downloaded and if not, download unzip etc. 
  - But, a bit fragile (permissions, changing paths, etc.)
  - Particularly for publication, generating a DOI with figshare/zenodo is a great and stable option
  
For Big data
  - i.e. you can't hold it or work with it all at onces on a reasonable computer
  - I recommend gpogle [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
  
---

# What to do about Results?

Data are at least (in theory) static. What do we do about results?

I've yet to come up with a solution that I'm really happy with, but here's my strategy

1. Create an automated system to version and store results ***locally***
  - e.g. this run is named "v1.0"
2. I try and avoid committing results to GitHub
  - Easy to create conflicts
  - Takes up a lot of space
  - Runs contrary to the entire point of reproducibility - if I do my job right future me or any collaborator can recreate the results on their own machine
  
Instead...

3. Push code that produced results to GitHub, and created a named version
  - That way you can always recreate those exact results

4. Coauthors should be able to recreate on their end!*

---

# Parameterized Markdown Reports

Papers are kind of a thing in science. We've made this amazing reproducible workflow to get numbers and graphs, but they don't pay the bills. 

How do we make sure that our final paper is reproducible?
  - Asking your students to go through your word doc and update all the coefficients by hand doesn't count

Enter R Markdown

---

# R Markdown

We don't have time to learn R Markdown, but here's the sales pitch

  - Automatically update all figures and tables as results change
  - Automatically update all in-text numbers as results change
  - Automatically number figures and tables as you move them around
    - Updates cross-references in the text
  - Automatically format and update references with your favorite reference manager
    - Rejected by Science? Just change the citation format, knit, and it's off to the next journal

Produce, PDF, Word, or HTML all from the same source material
  - Use Markdown, LaTeX, or Word templates to customize formatting
  - Generates all LaTeX files
    

---

# Collaborative Editing R Markdown

R Markdown sounds great! But..... **what about track changes**

I decide which way to go based on nature of paper
  - Literature review with 40 authors? R markdown is probably not the way to go. 
  
The (ideal) R Markdown Editing process

- Editor creates a branch off the main branch ("dans-edits")
- Makes changes, submits pull request
- Editor and lead author / team go through and approve / reject changes
- Merge "dans-edits" back ino main branch

Sounds hard, but honestly with practice it's easier than
  - Email .docx to 40 people
  - Get various versions of .docx and .pdf files back all with individual authors changes (some of which are on top of other people's changes)
  - Spend the next three nights crying with a bottle of whiskey while you try and reconcile it all
  - repeat.

# My Publication-Oriented Workflow

1. Do all the things we've talked about

2. Place all functions inside a "functions" folder

3. Create a wrapper script (make-my-paper.R) that calls everything needed to produce results

4. Specify results name inside wrapper script

5. pass parameters to R Markdown inside wrapper script and knit final product


---



# Let's see it in action

running `make-reprex.R` will run through this whole process. 

Walk through it to see how it all fits together

---


# In Summary....

- Project oriented workflow
  - Everything you need is contained nested folders, or downloaded by a script in a folder
  - Can you turn your project into a zipfile?
- Get rid of hard coded paths
  - Barrier to future you and collaborators
- Manage package dependencies
  - Use something like renv
- Generate dynamic reports with R Markdown
  - where applicable
- Collaborate with git + GitHub
